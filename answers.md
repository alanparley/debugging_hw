What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

These are inserted to make the application pause to help determine what a problem is - when we debug the application it will run until the line where the breakpoint is inserted where it will launch the debugger console.


Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No

How do we debug the next line of code?

Using the 'step over' option

What does the step into command do?

It switches to the first line of code that is referenced on the line you are on, even if the function is on a different class. 

What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression can be used to debug a single line of code. Evaluate code fragment lets you run multiple lines of code and assign temporary variables.
